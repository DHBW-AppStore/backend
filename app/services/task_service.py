"""Task lifecycle helpers.

Two-phase dispatch:

1. `prepare_task_in_tx` — INSERT a PENDING task row in the caller's
   transaction (no commit, no Celery I/O). The caller commits the
   surrounding business state and the new task row atomically.

2. `dispatch_to_celery` — outside the original TX, push the task to
   RabbitMQ. On success the row's `celeryTaskId` is stamped; on
   failure the row is marked FAILED. Either way the user sees a row
   in the deployment list reflecting reality — no splitbrain.
